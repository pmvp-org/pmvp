# Contributing

Thanks for checking out PMVP! We ask you to discuss proposed changes in issues before submitting any pull requests. We love new ideas, and we can best help you introduce them when we work together.

## Pull Request Guidelines

0. Update the CHANGELOG with a description of why you made these changes.
0. Include test coverage for your changes.
0. Include javadoc-style inline documentation. See existing code for examples.
